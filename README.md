Select the “Performance”.  And then look at the “Up time” on the bottom of this window.  Refer to the screen capture below.  If that number above the arrow is greater than 0, then your system has not been properly restarted.

This will resend links to the clients most resently entered contact information incase it has changed or there was a previous error sending the link.


### Meet Now:

If all else fails trying to connect using the scheduled telehealth appointment, you can use the meet now button to meet with a client. After clicking the "Meet Now" button, select yourself as the provider. Once you are in a meeting, you can add a participate buy clicking the "participants" button show here:

Next click "add participant(s)" which will give you a form to enter the clients first and last name, contact method, and contact information. Fill this form out and click "Add". This will send adirect link to the client that they can then join with.
